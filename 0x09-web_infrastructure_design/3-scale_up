3. Scale Up
Introduction
This project focuses on scaling up our web infrastructure to handle increased traffic and improve performance. The key components include an additional server, load balancer (HAProxy), and a distributed architecture for the web server, application server, and database.

Components
Additional Server:

Why it's added: To enhance system capacity and distribute the load effectively.
Example: If the existing server is reaching its limits, adding another server can handle more simultaneous users.
Load-Balancer (HAProxy) Cluster:

Why it's added: To distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers for improved performance and redundancy.
Example: Like a traffic cop directing cars, the load balancer ensures even distribution of user requests among available servers.
Split Components: Web Server, Application Server, Database:

Why it's added: Separating components allows for better scalability, fault isolation, and easier maintenance.
Example: In a restaurant, chefs specialize - one for preparing food (application server), one for serving (web server), and one managing ingredients (database).
Configuration
Ensure the HAProxy is configured as a cluster to achieve load balancing efficiently.

Conclusion
Scaling up the infrastructure improves the system's ability to handle more users and provides better reliability. Considerations such as load balancing and component separation contribute to a robust and scalable web architecture.

Explanation Of The Diagram:
Additional Server:

We've added a second server (www B 8.8.8.9) to distribute the load and enhance system capacity.
Load Balancer Cluster (HAProxy):

Configured as a cluster to distribute incoming traffic between the two web servers for better load balancing.
Split Components (Web Server, Application Server, Database):

Web Servers (Nginx) handle incoming HTTP requests.
Application Server processes dynamic content and executes application logic.
Database (MySQL) stores and manages structured data.
Conclusion:
The whiteboard infrastructure illustrates a scalable setup where the load balancer efficiently distributes traffic among multiple web servers, and each component has its dedicated server for improved scalability and fault isolation.
