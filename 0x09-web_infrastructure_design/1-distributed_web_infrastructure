### Explanations:

1. **Load Balancer (HAProxy):**
   - *Explanation:* Added to distribute incoming traffic among multiple servers for improved performance and reliability.
   - *Distribution Algorithm:* Configured with a Round Robin algorithm, directing each new request to the next server in line.

2. **Active-Active Setup:**
   - *Explanation:* The load balancer enables an Active-Active setup, where both web servers actively handle requests simultaneously.

3. **Database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) Cluster:**
   - *Explanation:* Setup for high availability and data redundancy. The primary node handles write operations, and the replica node mirrors the data for read operations.

4. **Difference between Primary and Replica Nodes:**
   - *Explanation:* The primary node accepts write operations, updating the database. The replica node mirrors the data from the primary and handles read operations to distribute the load.

### Issues:

1. **Single Points of Failure (SPOF):**
   - *Explanation:* Potential SPOFs include the load balancer and the DNS server, as their failure could impact the entire system.

2. **Security Issues:**
   - *Explanation:* Lack of firewall and HTTPS poses security risks. Implementing a firewall is crucial for controlling incoming and outgoing traffic, and HTTPS ensures secure communication.

3. **No Monitoring:**
   - *Explanation:* The absence of monitoring tools means there's no visibility into the system's health and performance, making it challenging to identify and address issues proactively.


In this example, the user is initiating a request to access the website www.foobar.com. Let's break down the user's actions in the context of the distributed web infrastructure:

1. **User's Computer (Browser):** The user opens their web browser and types in the URL www.foobar.com or clicks on a link pointing to that address.

2. **DNS Resolution:** The browser sends a request to the DNS server to resolve the domain name www.foobar.com to an IP address. In this case, the DNS server returns the IP address 8.8.8.8.

3. **Load Balancer Distribution:** The user's request is received by the load balancer (HAProxy). The load balancer, configured with a Round Robin algorithm, directs the request to one of the available web servers (either A or B).

4. **Web Server Processing:** The selected web server (e.g., Web Server A) processes the request, serving static content from /var/www/html or interacting with the application server and database for dynamic content.

5. **Application Server Interaction (if needed):** If dynamic content is required, the web server interacts with the application server, executing application logic using the provided codebase to generate dynamic content.

6. **Database Query (if needed):** If the application requires data from the database, the application server queries the MySQL database, which may involve both the primary and replica nodes.

7. **Response to User:** The web server generates a response, combining static and dynamic content, and sends it back to the user's browser through the load balancer.

8. **User View:** The user's browser renders the received content, displaying the website at www.foobar.com.

In summary, the user's actions involve initiating a request, which is then processed and fulfilled by the distributed web infrastructure, utilizing load balancing to distribute requests among multiple servers for improved performance and reliability.
