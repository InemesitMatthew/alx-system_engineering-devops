For Every Additional Element, Why You Are Adding It:

Explanation:
Firewalls: Added to control incoming and outgoing traffic, enhancing security.
SSL Certificate (HTTPS): Ensures encrypted traffic for secure communication.
Monitoring Clients: Used for real-time monitoring to identify and address issues promptly.
Example: Firewalls act like security guards, SSL is like an encrypted tunnel, and monitoring is your system's health check.
What Are Firewalls For:

Explanation: Firewalls control network traffic, acting as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks.
Example: Imagine a firewall as a security checkpoint; it decides which data can enter or leave the network.
Why Is the Traffic Served Over HTTPS:

Explanation: HTTPS encrypts data during transmission, securing sensitive information and preventing unauthorized access.
Example: Without HTTPS, it's like sending postcards (HTTP) instead of sealed envelopes (HTTPS) - anyone can read postcards.
What Monitoring Is Used For:

Explanation: Monitoring checks system performance, identifies issues, and ensures smooth operation.
Example: Monitoring is like a watchful guardian; it observes the system and alerts when something goes wrong.
How the Monitoring Tool Is Collecting Data:

Explanation: Monitoring tools collect data by analyzing logs, metrics, and events generated by servers.
Example: It's similar to a detective gathering clues; the monitoring tool pieces together information from server activities.
Explain What to Do If You Want to Monitor Your Web Server QPS:

Explanation: To monitor QPS (Queries Per Second), set up a monitoring tool to track server queries and analyze the data.
Example: Monitoring QPS is like counting how many customers enter a store each second.
Why Terminating SSL at the Load Balancer Level Is an Issue:

Explanation: Terminating SSL at the load balancer exposes decrypted traffic, risking security.
Example: It's like unlocking a secure package only at the doorstep instead of the recipient's hands.
Why Having Only One MySQL Server Capable of Accepting Writes Is an Issue:

Explanation: It creates a single point of failure; if the MySQL server fails, write operations are impacted.
Example: If the chef (MySQL server) is sick, the kitchen (database) can't accept new recipes (write operations).
Why Having Servers With All the Same Components Might Be a Problem:

Explanation: Lack of diversity may limit the system's ability to handle specific workloads or failures.
Example: It's like a soccer team with only goalkeepers; they can stop shots but can't score goals.
