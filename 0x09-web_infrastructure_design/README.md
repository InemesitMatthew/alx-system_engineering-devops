### Task 0: Simple Web Stack

#### Introduction:
This project focuses on designing a basic web infrastructure using a single server with a LAMP stack.

#### Components:
- **Server:** A single server hosting the web infrastructure.
- **Web Server (Nginx):** Handles incoming HTTP requests.
- **Application Server:** Processes dynamic content and executes application logic.
- **Database (MySQL):** Stores and manages structured data.

#### Code Example:
```bash
# Install Nginx and MySQL
sudo apt-get install nginx mysql-server

# Start Nginx and MySQL services
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl start mysql

# Check status
sudo systemctl status nginx
sudo systemctl status mysql
```

#### Explanation:
This setup allows for hosting a website with dynamic content using PHP and MySQL. However, it's limited in scalability and fault tolerance due to its single-server nature.

### Task 1: Distributed Web Infrastructure

#### Introduction:
In this task, we expand the web infrastructure to handle more traffic by distributing components across multiple servers.

#### Components:
- **Load Balancer (HAProxy):** Distributes incoming traffic among multiple web servers.
- **Web Server (Nginx):** Handles incoming HTTP requests.
- **Application Server:** Processes dynamic content and executes application logic.
- **Database (MySQL):** Stores and manages structured data.

#### Code Example:
```bash
# Install HAProxy
sudo apt-get install haproxy

# Configure HAProxy
# Add backend servers and set load balancing algorithm
```

#### Explanation:
By distributing components and adding a load balancer, we achieve better scalability and fault tolerance. HAProxy ensures even distribution of user requests among available servers, improving performance.

### Task 2: Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure

#### Introduction:
This task focuses on enhancing security and monitoring capabilities of the web infrastructure.

#### Components:
- **Firewalls:** Control incoming and outgoing traffic, enhancing security.
- **SSL Certificate (HTTPS):** Encrypts traffic for secure communication.
- **Monitoring Clients:** Provide real-time monitoring to identify and address issues promptly.

#### Code Example:
```bash
# Configure firewalls to allow necessary traffic
# Install and configure SSL certificate for HTTPS
# Set up monitoring clients (e.g., Sumologic) to collect logs and metrics
```

#### Explanation:
Adding firewalls improves security by controlling traffic flow. HTTPS encryption protects sensitive data during transmission. Monitoring clients ensure system health and prompt detection of issues.

### Task 3: Scale Up

#### Introduction:
This task focuses on scaling up the web infrastructure to handle increased traffic and improve performance.

#### Components:
- **Additional Server:** Enhances system capacity and distributes load effectively.
- **Load Balancer (HAProxy) Cluster:** Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers for improved performance and redundancy.
- **Split Components:** Web Server, Application Server, Database, each with its own server for better scalability and fault isolation.

#### Code Example:
```bash
# Add additional server
# Configure load balancer as a cluster
# Split components into separate servers
```

#### Explanation:
Scaling up the infrastructure allows for handling more users and provides better reliability. Load balancing and component separation contribute to a robust and scalable web architecture.
