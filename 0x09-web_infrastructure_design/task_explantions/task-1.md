1. **For Every Additional Element, Why You Are Adding It:**
   - *Explanation:* Each element serves a specific purpose:
     - Load Balancer: Distributes incoming traffic for better performance and reliability.
     - Second Web Server: Enhances system capacity, allowing more simultaneous users.
     - Database Replica: Provides data redundancy and improves read performance.

2. **Distribution Algorithm (Round Robin in HAProxy):**
   - *Explanation:* The load balancer uses a Round Robin algorithm, directing each new request to the next server in line.
   - *Example:* If there are three servers (A, B, C), Round Robin sends requests like A → B → C → A → B...

3. **Active-Active Setup:**
   - *Explanation:* Both web servers actively handle requests simultaneously.
   - *Example:* If a user accesses www.foobar.com, either web server A or B can respond, distributing the load evenly.

4. **Database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) Cluster:**
   - *Explanation:* Ensures high availability and data redundancy. Primary node handles writes, and replica node mirrors data for reads.
   - *Example:* When a user updates their profile, the write operation goes to the primary node. When another user reads the profile, it can be served by the replica node.

5. **Difference Between Primary and Replica Nodes:**
   - *Explanation:* 
     - Primary Node: Handles write operations, updating the database with changes.
     - Replica Node: Mirrors data from the primary and handles read operations to distribute the load.
   - *Example:* If a new record is added, it goes to the primary. When a user queries data, it can be served by the replica, reducing the load on the primary.

6. **Single Points of Failure (SPOF):**
   - *Explanation:* Potential SPOFs include the load balancer and the DNS server. If they fail, the entire system may become inaccessible.
   - *Example:* If the load balancer fails, incoming requests won't be distributed, leading to uneven server loads.

7. **Security Issues (No Firewall, No HTTPS):**
   - *Explanation:* Lack of firewall exposes the system to unauthorized access. Absence of HTTPS compromises data security during communication.
   - *Example:* Without a firewall, malicious actors could attempt to access sensitive information. Without HTTPS, data transmitted between users and servers can be intercepted.

8. **No Monitoring:**
   - *Explanation:* The absence of monitoring tools makes it challenging to identify and address issues proactively, risking downtime.
   - *Example:* If there's a sudden increase in traffic, without monitoring, it may go unnoticed, impacting performance.
