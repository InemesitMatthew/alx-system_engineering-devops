1. **What is a Server:**
   - *Explanation:* A server is a computer or software that provides services to other computers, like hosting a website.
   - *Example:* In this task, the server is a computer hosting the website at www.foobar.com.

2. **Role of the Domain Name:**
   - *Explanation:* The domain name is the human-readable address used to access a website, directing users to the server's IP.
   - *Example:* www.foobar.com is the domain name pointing to the server at 8.8.8.8.

3. **Type of DNS Record (www):**
   - *Explanation:* The DNS record type for www in www.foobar.com is an A record, linking the domain to the server's IP.
   - *Example:* A DNS A record translates www.foobar.com to 8.8.8.8.

4. **Role of the Web Server (Nginx):**
   - *Explanation:* The web server (Nginx) handles incoming HTTP requests and serves static content like HTML and CSS.
   - *Example:* Nginx serves files from /var/www/html to users' browsers.

5. **Role of the Application Server:**
   - *Explanation:* The application server processes dynamic content and executes application logic based on the codebase.
   - *Example:* It generates personalized content on www.foobar.com.

6. **Role of the Database (MySQL):**
   - *Explanation:* The database (MySQL) stores structured data for the application, ensuring efficient data management.
   - *Example:* It stores user information or product details.

7. **Server Communication with User's Computer:**
   - *Explanation:* The server communicates with the user's computer using the HTTP protocol over the internet.
   - *Example:* When a user accesses www.foobar.com, the server uses HTTP to send web pages.

8. **Single Point of Failure (SPOF):**
   - *Explanation:* SPOF means if one part fails, the entire system fails. In this case, relying on a single server poses a risk.
   - *Example:* If the server at 8.8.8.8 goes down, www.foobar.com becomes inaccessible.

9. **Downtime During Maintenance:**
   - *Explanation:* Restarting the web server for tasks like deploying new code can lead to temporary downtime.
   - *Example:* When updating the website, users might experience a brief period where it's not accessible.

10. **Cannot Scale with Incoming Traffic:**
    - *Explanation:* The current setup may struggle to handle a high volume of incoming traffic, limiting scalability.
    - *Example:* If many users try to access www.foobar.com simultaneously, the server may become overwhelmed.
