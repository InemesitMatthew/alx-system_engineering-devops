What is a Server:

Explanation: A server is a computer or software that provides services to other computers, like hosting a website.
Example: In this task, the server is a computer hosting the website at www.foobar.com.

Role of the Domain Name:

Explanation: The domain name is the human-readable address used to access a website, directing users to the server's IP.
Example: www.foobar.com is the domain name pointing to the server at 8.8.8.8.

Type of DNS Record (www):

Explanation: The DNS record type for www in www.foobar.com is an A record, linking the domain to the server's IP.
Example: A DNS A record translates www.foobar.com to 8.8.8.8.

Role of the Web Server (Nginx):

Explanation: The web server (Nginx) handles incoming HTTP requests and serves static content like HTML and CSS.
Example: Nginx serves files from /var/www/html to users' browsers.

Role of the Application Server:

Explanation: The application server processes dynamic content and executes application logic based on the codebase.
Example: It generates personalized content on www.foobar.com.

Role of the Database (MySQL):

Explanation: The database (MySQL) stores structured data for the application, ensuring efficient data management.
Example: It stores user information or product details.

Server Communication with User's Computer:

Explanation: The server communicates with the user's computer using the HTTP protocol over the internet.
Example: When a user accesses www.foobar.com, the server uses HTTP to send web pages.

Single Point of Failure (SPOF):

Explanation: SPOF means if one part fails, the entire system fails. In this case, relying on a single server poses a risk.
Example: If the server at 8.8.8.8 goes down, www.foobar.com becomes inaccessible.

Downtime During Maintenance:

Explanation: Restarting the web server for tasks like deploying new code can lead to temporary downtime.
Example: When updating the website, users might experience a brief period where it's not accessible.

Cannot Scale with Incoming Traffic:

Explanation: The current setup may struggle to handle a high volume of incoming traffic, limiting scalability.
Example: If many users try to access www.foobar.com simultaneously, the server may become overwhelmed.
