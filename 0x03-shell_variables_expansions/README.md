### Task 0: Creating an Alias
**File:** `0-alias`

**Code:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
alias ls="rm *"
```

**Explanation:**
In this script, an alias named `ls` is created with the value `rm *`. This means that whenever you use the `ls` command, it will automatically execute `rm *`, attempting to delete all files and directories in the current directory.

### Task 1: Hello You
**File:** `1-hello_you`

**Code:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello $USER"
```

**Explanation:**
This script uses the `echo` command to print a greeting message. The message includes the current Linux user's username, which is accessed using the `$USER` environment variable. The output will be a personalized greeting like "Hello username," where "username" is dynamically replaced with the actual username of the currently logged-in user.

### Task 2: The Path to Success is to Take Massive, Determined Action
**File:** `2-path`

**Code:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
export PATH=$PATH:/action
```

**Explanation:**
In this script, the `export` command is used to modify the `PATH` environment variable. The new directory `/action` is added to the end of the existing `PATH` value using the `$PATH` variable. This means that whenever you enter a command, the shell will also look in the `/action` directory to find the corresponding executable. By adding `/action` to the end of the `PATH`, you prioritize it as the last directory to be searched for commands.

### Task 3: If the Path be Beautiful, Let us not Ask Where it Leads
**File:** `3-paths`

**Code:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo $PATH | tr -s ':' '\n' | wc -l
```

**Explanation:**
In this task, a script is created to count the number of directories in the `PATH` environment variable. The script uses a series of commands to achieve this in just two lines. Here's how it works:
1. The `echo $PATH` command outputs the contents of the `PATH` variable.
2. The `tr -s ':' '\n'` command replaces the `:` delimiter with newline characters, effectively splitting the `PATH` string into separate lines for each directory.
3. The `wc -l` command counts the number of lines, which corresponds to the number of directories in the `PATH`.

### Task 4: Global Variables
**File:** `4-global_variables`

**Code:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
printenv
```

**Explanation:**
This script lists all the environment variables in the system using the `printenv` command. Environment variables are global variables that are accessible by all processes in the system. The script simply prints out a comprehensive list of these variables.

---

### Task 5: Local Variables
**File:** `5-local_variables`

**Code:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set | grep -E '^[a-zA-Z_]+='
```

**Explanation:**
In this task, a script is created to list all local variables, environment variables, and functions. The `set` command is used to display all variables and functions. The output is then filtered using `grep` to display lines that match the pattern of valid variable names (starting with letters or underscores and followed by letters, digits, or underscores).

---

### Task 6: Local Variable
**File:** `6-create_local_variable`

**Code:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
BEST="School"
```

**Explanation:**
In this task, a script is created to define a new local variable named `BEST` with the value `School`. The script assigns the value `School` to the local variable `BEST`.

---

### Task 7: Global Variable
**File:** `7-create_global_variable`

**Code:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
export BEST="School"
```

**Explanation:**
In this task, a script is created to define a new global variable named `BEST` with the value `School`. The `export` command is used to make the variable `BEST` available to child processes as well.

---

### Task 8: Every Addition to True Knowledge is an Addition to Human Power
**File:** `8-true_knowledge`

**Code:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo $((128 + $TRUEKNOWLEDGE))
```

**Explanation:**
In this task, a script is created to print the result of adding 128 to the value stored in the environment variable `TRUEKNOWLEDGE`. The arithmetic expansion `$(( ... ))` is used to perform the addition, and the result is echoed to the terminal.

---

### Task 9: Divide and Rule
**File:** `9-divide_and_rule`

**Code:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo $(($POWER / $DIVIDE))
```

**Explanation:**
This script calculates the result of dividing the value stored in the environment variable `POWER` by the value stored in the environment variable `DIVIDE`. The arithmetic expansion `$(( ... ))` is used for the division, and the result is displayed using the `echo` command.

---

### Task 10: Love is Anterior to Life, Posterior to Death, Initial of Creation, and the Exponent of Breath
**File:** `10-love_exponent_breath`

**Code:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo $(($BREATH ** $LOVE))
```

**Explanation:**
This script calculates the result of raising the value stored in the environment variable `BREATH` to the power of the value stored in the environment variable `LOVE`. The `**` operator represents exponentiation, and the result is displayed using the `echo` command.
