### Task 0: Creating an Alias
**File:** `0-alias`

**Code:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
alias ls="rm *"
```

**Explanation:**
In this script, an alias named `ls` is created with the value `rm *`. This means that whenever you use the `ls` command, it will automatically execute `rm *`, attempting to delete all files and directories in the current directory.

---

### Task 1: Hello You
**File:** `1-hello_you`

**Code:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello $USER"
```

**Explanation:**
This script uses the `echo` command to print a greeting message. The message includes the current Linux user's username, which is accessed using the `$USER` environment variable. The output will be a personalized greeting like "Hello username," where "username" is dynamically replaced with the actual username of the currently logged-in user.

---

### Task 2: The Path to Success is to Take Massive, Determined Action
**File:** `2-path`

**Code:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
export PATH=$PATH:/action
```

**Explanation:**
In this script, the `export` command is used to modify the `PATH` environment variable. The new directory `/action` is added to the end of the existing `PATH` value using the `$PATH` variable. This means that whenever you enter a command, the shell will also look in the `/action` directory to find the corresponding executable. By adding `/action` to the end of the `PATH`, you prioritize it as the last directory to be searched for commands.

---

### Task 3: If the Path be Beautiful, Let us not Ask Where it Leads
**File:** `3-paths`

**Code:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo $PATH | tr -s ':' '\n' | wc -l
```

**Explanation:**
In this task, a script is created to count the number of directories in the `PATH` environment variable. The script uses a series of commands to achieve this in just two lines. Here's how it works:
1. The `echo $PATH` command outputs the contents of the `PATH` variable.
2. The `tr -s ':' '\n'` command replaces the `:` delimiter with newline characters, effectively splitting the `PATH` string into separate lines for each directory.
3. The `wc -l` command counts the number of lines, which corresponds to the number of directories in the `PATH`.

---

### Task 4: Global Variables
**File:** `4-global_variables`

**Code:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
printenv
```

**Explanation:**
This script lists all the environment variables in the system using the `printenv` command. Environment variables are global variables that are accessible by all processes in the system. The script simply prints out a comprehensive list of these variables.

---

### Task 5: Local Variables
**File:** `5-local_variables`

**Code:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set | grep -E '^[a-zA-Z_]+='
```

**Explanation:**
In this task, a script is created to list all local variables, environment variables, and functions. The `set` command is used to display all variables and functions. The output is then filtered using `grep` to display lines that match the pattern of valid variable names (starting with letters or underscores and followed by letters, digits, or underscores).

---

### Task 6: Local Variable
**File:** `6-create_local_variable`

**Code:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
BEST="School"
```

**Explanation:**
In this task, a script is created to define a new local variable named `BEST` with the value `School`. The script assigns the value `School` to the local variable `BEST`.

---

### Task 7: Global Variable
**File:** `7-create_global_variable`

**Code:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
export BEST="School"
```

**Explanation:**
In this task, a script is created to define a new global variable named `BEST` with the value `School`. The `export` command is used to make the variable `BEST` available to child processes as well.

---

### Task 8: Every Addition to True Knowledge is an Addition to Human Power
**File:** `8-true_knowledge`

**Code:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo $((128 + $TRUEKNOWLEDGE))
```

**Explanation:**
In this task, a script is created to print the result of adding 128 to the value stored in the environment variable `TRUEKNOWLEDGE`. The arithmetic expansion `$(( ... ))` is used to perform the addition, and the result is echoed to the terminal.

---

### Task 9: Divide and Rule
**File:** `9-divide_and_rule`

**Code:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo $(($POWER / $DIVIDE))
```

**Explanation:**
This script calculates the result of dividing the value stored in the environment variable `POWER` by the value stored in the environment variable `DIVIDE`. The arithmetic expansion `$(( ... ))` is used for the division, and the result is displayed using the `echo` command.

---

### Task 10: Love is Anterior to Life, Posterior to Death, Initial of Creation, and the Exponent of Breath
**File:** `10-love_exponent_breath`

**Code:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo $(($BREATH ** $LOVE))
```

**Explanation:**
This script calculates the result of raising the value stored in the environment variable `BREATH` to the power of the value stored in the environment variable `LOVE`. The `**` operator represents exponentiation, and the result is displayed using the `echo` command.

---

### Task 11: There are 10 Types of People in the World -- Those Who Understand Binary, and Those Who Don't
**File:** `11-binary_to_decimal`

**Code:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo $((2#$BINARY))
```

**Explanation:**
This script converts a number from base 2 (binary) to base 10 (decimal). The value stored in the environment variable `BINARY` is treated as a binary number and is converted using the arithmetic expansion `$(( ... ))`. The result is displayed in base 10.

---

### Task 12: Combination
**File:** `12-combinations`

**Code:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
for i in {a..z}{a..z}; do [ "$i" != "oo" ] && echo "$i"; done
```

**Explanation:**
This script uses a single-line loop to generate all possible combinations of two letters (lowercase, from a to z) except "oo." The combinations are printed one per line.

---

### Task 13: Floats
**File:** `13-print_float`

**Code:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
printf "%.2f\n" $NUM
```

**Explanation:**
In this task, a number with two decimal places is printed. The value is taken from the environment variable `NUM`, and the `printf` command is used with the format specifier `"%.2f"` to ensure that the number is displayed with exactly two decimal places.

---

### Task 14: Decimal to Hexadecimal
**File:** `100-decimal_to_hexadecimal`

**Code:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "obase=16; $DECIMAL" | bc
```

**Explanation:**
This script converts a number from base 10 (decimal) to base 16 (hexadecimal). The value stored in the environment variable `DECIMAL` is passed to the `bc` (basic calculator) command using the `obase=16;` prefix. The result is displayed in base 16.

---

### Task 15: Everyone is a Proponent of Strong Encryption
**File:** `101-rot13`

**Code:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "$1" | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'
```

**Explanation:**
This script performs ROT13 encryption and decryption on text input. The input text is passed as a command-line argument to the script. The `tr` command is used to perform the ROT13 transformation on alphabetic characters while leaving non-alphabetic characters unchanged.

---

### Task 16: The Eggs of the Brood Need to Be an Odd Number
**File:** `102-odd`

**Code:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
sed -n 'p;n' $1
```

**Explanation:**
This script prints every other line from the input file. It uses the `sed` command to achieve this. The `-n` flag suppresses automatic printing, and the `p;n` command prints the current line and moves to the next line, effectively printing every other line.

---

### Task 17: I'm an Instant Star. Just Add Water and Stir.
**File:** `103-water_and_stir`

**Code:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
result=$(echo "ibase=$WATER;obase=$STIR;$WATER + $STIR" | bc); echo "ibase=$STIR;obase=$BESTCHOL;$result" | bc
```

**Explanation:**
In this script, two calculations are performed in a single line. First, the sum of `WATER` and `STIR` is calculated in base `STIR`. Then, the result is converted to base `BESTCHOL` using the `bc` (basic calculator) command. The entire calculation and conversion are done in one line.
